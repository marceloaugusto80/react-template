# react-template

## Overview

Basic fron-end template. 

## Techs

Core based on [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Tests powered by [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).

Build and bundling by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

Test run already defined if you are using [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## How to

Install [Node](https://nodejs.org) if you don't have it.

It's nice to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed too.

Clone the repo.

Open the terminal in the project folder and type:
```
npm install
```

### To run the tests:

In Visual Code press F5 or open the terminal in the project folder and type:
```
npm test
```



## TODO

* use webpack dev server to spin the webapp. Current I'm using [static-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server) package installed globally.
